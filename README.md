# SQL Practice Journey

This repository documents my hands-on journey into SQL — writing, refining, and debugging queries from scratch to build real fluency and confidence. Every line of code here was created as part of a self-paced, challenge-driven training plan to prepare for a career in data analytics.

## What You'll Find

- Foundational queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `AND/OR`, `NOT`, and more
- Advanced filtering with `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and `LIMIT`
- Organized progression from basic commands to complex, multi-condition logic
- Fully commented query files for clarity and learning reflection

## Why This Repo Exists

I'm building toward a career in analytics — and this project is both my training ground and proof of growth. These aren't copied exercises. They're real examples of trial, error, and improvement.

## Coming Soon

- Mini-projects using public datasets
- SQL scripts with JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries
- Integration with Tableau, Power BI, and Excel
